'''
CLASSES AND OOP
===============

Define a python class that describes a book object.

Every instance of the class should have:
a title,
an author,
a total page number,
and a current page number (where the reader is at)

Also, define a method that allows the user to read the book for a certain number of pages
Calling the method should update the current page number accordingly.

Inform the user if they've reached the end of the book! :)

Have fun, and no cheating ;)
